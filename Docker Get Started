How to build an app in Docker
  Dockerfile: The running environment and system settings of the container
  App itself: App code 
  Files: Files needed in the app

Files will be `added` in the container by editting Dockerfile,
eg.:
  # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
  ADD . /app
  
Docker command

$ docker pull
$ docker run
$ docker ps
$ docker images
$ docker stop
$ docker push

Docker Service 

docker-compose.yml: Defines how docker container should behave in production

Docker Swarm
A built-in cluster management module. Master-Worker pattern.
Can switch between swarm mode and stand-alone mode.

Type the following command, the computer will turn into Swarm mode, and automatically become the swarm manager(Master node).
  $ docker swarm init --advertise-addr localhost:2377
For the other nodes you to add into the swarm as workers
  $ docker swarm join --token <token> <ip>:<port>
  token is an unique string the swarm manager print out when it started. ip:port is master_ip:2377

Docker Stack
A stack is a group of interrelated services that share dependencies, and can be orchestrated and scaled together.

docker-compose install:
$ curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.13.0/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
$ chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
$ docker-compose --version
